## Setting up Virtual Environment

To set up the Python virtual environment for this project:

1. Navigate to the ds-fundamentals directory:
```bash
cd ds-fundamentals
```

2. Create a new virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

When activated, your command prompt will show `(venv)` at the beginning, indicating you're working within the virtual environment.

To deactivate the virtual environment when you're done:
```bash
deactivate
```
